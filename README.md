A minimalistic grey new tab page for Google Chrome. No external network requests. No analytics. No tracking. No bullshit.
FORKED FROM: https://github.com/dandydanny/darknewtab
My additions: nothing but some common links I use

### What?
1. A minimalistic new tab page replacement for Chrome.
1. New tab page fades from black to dark grey; easy on your eyes.

### Why?
1. Default Chrome new tab page makes network requests and show thumbnail images of previously visited sites
Some new tab page extensions can be slow to launch if system is low on resources
1. I don't want distractions
1. I don't want to be binded by a white page whenever I open a new tab
